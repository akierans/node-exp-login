# Nodejs login app

This is a sample website built in Node.js using Express and contains a login form, this is based off the [auth0 tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/create-a-simple-and-stylish-node-express-app/).

## Motivation
The motivation behind this is learning more about frontend development, and practicing Node.js

## Technology
This project has been built using
Node.js (12.18.1)
npm (6.14.5)
Express
Pug

and later
Nodemon

## Features

## Installation
Install nodejs
Install npm
Clone the project to a local directory
```
git clone https://github.com/akierans/node-exp-login.git
```

## Run Instructions
Once installed run the following
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
Unless you have amended any settings you will now be able to access the test site on localhost:8000/

If you want to run with browser-sync to make life easier while developing instead run
```
npm run i
npm run dev
npm run ui
```
Unless you have amended any settings you will now be able to access the test site on localhost:3000/
As browser-sync only creates a static server, you still need to run the site in nodemon.
